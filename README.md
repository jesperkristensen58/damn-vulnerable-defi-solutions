# Solutions to Damn Vulnerable DeFi

This is my own solutions to Damn Vulnerable DeFi.
The repo is v2.2.0 from Damn Vulnerable DeFi.

How to Solve:
==============
Go to one of the open challenges.
If you need to add contracts (like an attacker contract), add it to the `contracts/` folder.

Then solve the problem by running the test with the corresponding name. Simply run:

```shell
yarn <test name>
```

For example, to solve `Climber`, run:

```shell
yarn climber
```

If this run fails you have not solved the challenge. Keep trying until it passes.

Solutions added thus far:

- [x] Climber

... and more will be added soon!
